Here is a lovely new file that I am going to commit to git.
It's going to be great.

1. Edit a file like this one.
2. "Commit" it to your local git repository.
3. Sync ("push") it to the remote repository.
4. Say someone else changes a file on the remote repository.
4. Then you can sync ("pull") it to your local repository.
